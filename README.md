Blokus Duo is the classic strategy game for two players! <br>
Players take turns placing their 21 pieces on the board, and each piece must touch another of the same color, but only at the corners
Stake your claim and protect your territory by fitting as many of your pieces on the board as possible while strategically blocking your opponent! <br>
The game ends when no more pieces can be placed down, and the player with fewer pieces remaining wins! <br>
